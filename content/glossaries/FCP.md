First Contentful Paint (FCP) is an important, user-centric metric for measuring perceived load speed because it marks the first point in the page load timeline where the user can see anything on the screenâ€”a fast FCP helps reassure the user that something is happening. The First Contentful Paint (FCP) metric measures the time from when the page starts loading to when any part of the page's content is rendered on the screen. For this metric, "**content**" refers to text, images (including background images), `<svg>` elements, or non-white `<canvas>` elements.
